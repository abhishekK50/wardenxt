    "api-service",

  "root_cause": {
    "primary": "Memory leak in ORM layer preventing connection cleanup",
    "secondary": "Connection pool size insufficient for peak load with slow queries",
    "contributing_factors": [
      "Recent refactoring (v3.2.1) changed connection management",
      "No load testing with connection pool monitoring",
      "Alert threshold too high (85% instead of 80%)"

  "estimated_cost": "$780,000",
  "users_impacted": "12,400+ failed requests",
  "mitigation_steps": [
    "Identified connection leak via database monitoring dashboard (Completed: 15:15)",
    "Emergency rollback of application to v3.2.0 (Completed: 15:30)",
    "Killed all idle database connections via pg_terminate_backend() (Completed: 15:30)",
    "Restarted application servers to clear connection state (Completed: 15:35)",
    "Increased connection pool monitoring granularity (Completed: 15:45)",
    "Added connection leak detection unit tests to CI/CD (Planned)"
  ],
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Connection pool monitoring must alert at 80% utilization, not 85%",
    "ORM refactoring requires load testing with connection pool monitoring",
    "Database connection leaks are silent killers - hard to detect until failure",
    "Need automated connection leak detection in pre-production",
    "Rollback procedures must be tested quarterly"
