  "services_affected": [
    "matv-database",
    "transaction-processing",
    "archive-system",
    "reporting-engine",

  "root_cause": {
    "primary": "Hardware failure - Disk controller malfunction",
    "secondary": "Single point of failure - No redundant controller in place",
    "contributing_factors": [
      "Server hardware aging (3+ years in production)",
      "No proactive hardware monitoring for controller health",
      "Backup frequency insufficient (6-hour intervals)"
    ]
  },
  "estimated_cost": "$250,000",
  "users_impacted": "2,400+ users (all transaction processing)",
  "mitigation_steps": [
    "Verify backup availability and integrity (Completed: 02:35)",
    "Prepare replacement hardware with redundant controllers (Completed: 02:50)",
    "Initiate BMR recovery process from backup (Started: 02:45)",
    "Monitor recovery progress and validate each phase (Ongoing: 02:45-08:00)",
    "Restore operating system and base configuration (Completed: 04:30)",
    "Restore database software and binaries (Completed: 05:15)",
    "Restore data files from backup (Completed: 06:15)",
    "Run comprehensive data integrity checks (Completed: 07:45)",
    "Validate database consistency and transaction logs (Completed: 07:50)",
    "Resume service and monitor stability (Completed: 08:00)",
    "Communicate status to all stakeholders (Ongoing)"
  ],
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Implement hardware redundancy (RAID controller failover) - Priority: HIGH",
    "Reduce backup frequency from 6 hours to 1 hour for critical databases - Priority: HIGH",
    "Create and maintain detailed BMR runbook for faster recovery - Priority: MEDIUM",
    "Implement database replication for high availability - Priority: HIGH",
    "Add proactive hardware health monitoring and alerting - Priority: MEDIUM",
    "Conduct quarterly DR (Disaster Recovery) drills - Priority: MEDIUM",
    "Document and automate BMR procedures to reduce MTTR - Priority: HIGH"
